Helplessly inquisitive data scientist amazed and humbled by the world around us. Did you know that Machine Learning can detect distribution transformer failures weeks in advance, but a single squirrel chewing wires has twice crashed the Nasdaq?  

Data is the lens through which I see the world and ways to improve it.  My academic background in environmental science and global health honed my knack for distilling complex research questions into clearly communicated analyses. As a Data Scientist at a Chicago AI startup, Uptake, I have driven models from user needs assessments to data engineering to model deployment.  My models are live in customer applications to maximize the reliability of the electic grid infrastructure. 

In addition to occasional side projects on data visualization (see Blog posts), you may also find me:
