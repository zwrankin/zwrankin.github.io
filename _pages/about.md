Helplessly inquisitive data scientist amazed and humbled by the world around us. Did you know that Machine Learning can detect distribution transformer failures weeks in advance, but a single squirrel chewing wires has twice crashed the Nasdaq?  

Data is the lens through which I see the world and ways to improve it.  My academic background in environmental science and global health honed a knack for distilling complex research questions into clearly communicated analyses. As a Data Scientist at an [AI startup](https://www.uptake.com/), I have driven models from user needs assessments to data engineering to deployment.  These models are live in customer applications to maximize the reliability of the electic grid infrastructure. 

In my free time, I enjoy side projects on data visualization (while making this website during COVID-19, I also used [Fitbit data to analyze the effect of social distancing](https://towardsdatascience.com/fattening-the-curve-134eebc22b26)). You may also find me:
